## Introduction

**Palindrome Checker** is a simple yet effective tool that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Features

- **Real-time Checking:** Enter a word or phrase, and see instantly if it's a palindrome.
- **Case Insensitivity:** The checker is case-insensitive, so it works regardless of capitalization.
- **Ignores Non-Alphanumeric Characters:** Spaces, punctuation, and special characters are ignored, making it versatile for various inputs.
